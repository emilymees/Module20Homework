## Analysis Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to analyze lending data and build models to help identify borrowers' creditworthiness. Unfortunately we do see a significant class imbalance between healthy loans (75,036) and high-risk loans (2,500), which could negatively impact our model's performance. 



## Results

<strong>Logistic Regression Model 1:</strong>

* Precision: 100% accuracy predicting healthy loans, 87% accuracy predicting high-risk loans
* Accuracy: 94% balanced accuracy score
* Recall: 100% recall for healthy loans, 89% recall for high-risk loans
